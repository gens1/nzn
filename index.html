      <p>New Zealand Now wants young people to have easy transport and education that is cheaper and more effective. Only  We want public transport to be a better option by making bigger fleets and costs cheaper. We also want the education better by paying teachers more, and handing out better pays to better teachers, we also want to make New Zealand 100% renewable by 2030 to battle climate change. Global warming is also a big problem that we want to battle by making New Zealand's energy 100% renewable by 2030.</p>

        <h2>Policy 1: Public transport upgraded and fares decreased</h2>
        <p> Public transport is under-used because it’s not reliable and needs to be cheaper. Only 30 percent of people in New Zealand used public transport at some point in the past 12 months. We want make the system more accurate for when they come and add more buses for not so long waits. Costs will also be decreased for everyone while keeping the half minor cost. Many of the bus systems are not reliable causing many people not to use them as they could miss an event because of a late or cancelled bus. We wish to improve this system to fix the problem. We want to solve this by creating jobs for manegment of bus systems and giving them a fair pay. Fares are not that much of a problem, but lowering fares could encourage more to use public transport. We also aim to make all public transport electrical. Our other competertors aren’t increasing the reliability of buses or making them more environmentally friendly. Society will change to have public transport as an efficient, reliable way to travel saving resources and the world. Our policy will overall make public transport a very good way to travel for a good price.  </p>

        <h2> Policy 2: Teacher pays review and add a reward fund for excellent teacheing work </h2>
        <p> There are not too many teachers because of how little they are payed for how much they do. They are only paid around $70,000 to $85,000 per year. This has been caused by time going passed as money is worth less and teachers not being payed at the same rate as the money change. This has been the government's fault not paying teachers more. Not too many parties have policies to do with this. These parties are usually smaller party's or don't add too much more to the pay. My policy will increase teachers' pay by how much we think they are working. We also want to hand out bigger sums to teachers who do more work such as a head of a department.  We wish to review and increase teachers' pay. This has been overlooked for too long as teachers do a lot of work. We also wish to improve teachers stay at school. We want teachers to have better offices, staff rooms, and learning tools to teach with. This will make becoming a teacher a good job and the lack of teaching jobs will disappear.</p>

        <h2> Policy 3: Aiming for 100% renewable energy by 2028 </h2>
        <p> Global warming is heating the world up, this has been caused by humans emmiting 36.6 billion tons in just 2023. Having all our sources of energy renewable. This change will also save money in the long run, you are also spending nothing to keep the windmills, hydro dams, and solar panels operating. Global warming is the problem that needs to be fixed. Global warming will keep heating up the world melting the ice caps flooding the Earh.  Some other parties have the same goal but have not executed it.  Make New Zealand have 100% renewable energy. The policy will help the fight against climate change and save money in the long run. We want to make New Zealand 100% renewable which helps to fight climate change and save money in the long run. This will create a healthier, cleaner enviroment for New Zealand. </p>

    <section id="coalition">
        <h2> Possible Coalitions: </h2>
        <p> Our party has two options, Green Party, Labour Party. The green party beleives in protecting New Zealands enviroment and battling climate change too. They meet out values and beliefs too. Labour party is also a good option to coalition with. They beleive equality and want to improve equality to all. This matches how we want to think when we improve parts of New Zealand such as public transport and education. Labour party has a simlar policy to our Teachers pay review policy and Green party has a similar policy to our renewable energy policy.</p>
